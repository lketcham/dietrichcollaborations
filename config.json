    "more": "This network visualization illustrates how those who worked on Marlene Dietrich’s films collaborated with each other. The data only encompasses those films Dietrich herself worked on, not all films each collaborator has worked on individually. For the purposes of illustrating collaboration between Dietrich’s collaborators, and given that all nodes would share a connection to Dietrich, we decided to omit Dietrich herself from the visualization. The network illustrates ‘common links’ between Dietrich’s films - or her most frequent collaborators, versus films and individuals that may be more distant from the work at the core of her portfolio. There are a few clusters of note, with key collaborators anchoring each one. These clusters are colored according to their modularity class (how closely related nodes are). This breaks the network up into groups of films, and films where it’s clear there are no common collaborators, besides Dietrich herself. The largest cluster (purple) on the left represents mostly films and collaborators of Josef von Sternberg and the light blue cluster contains collaborators who worked with or are only one degree away from John Wayne, for example. Users can hover over nodes to explore the structure of the network.
